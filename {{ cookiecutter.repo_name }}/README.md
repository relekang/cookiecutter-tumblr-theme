# {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} 

Build with `grunt` or `grunt watch`. When the project
is built the template will be added to your clipboard.
This means that after a build you can just head over
to Tumblr and paste your template.

## Install dependecies
    npm install

### Install grunt-cli
If you have not used grunt before you need grunt-cli installed globally.

    npm install -g grunt-cli
